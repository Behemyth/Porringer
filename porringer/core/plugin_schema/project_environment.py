"""Core helpers and types for project environment.

Plugin utilities for project-scoped environments.

A `ProjectInstaller` plugin wraps a project dependency manager
(PDM, Poetry, uv) and delegates venv creation, dependency resolution,
and lock-file installation entirely to the underlying tool.

The engine invokes `ProjectInstaller.command_plan()` to build the
sync command, then runs its steps directly, after all per-package
actions have completed so that the tool itself is already installed
(e.g. via pipx).  `command_plan()` is each plugin's single source of
truth: the same steps are executed and shown in preview, so a
previewed command can never diverge from what actually runs.  When
the manifest file lives in a subdirectory of the project root, each
plugin auto-discovers the correct project root by walking ancestor
directories looking for its ecosystem's marker file (e.g.
`package.json` for Node, `pyproject.toml` for Python).
